## Anotações 🗒

- importância semântica na hora do HTML
	- listas ordenadas ou não-ordenadas?
	- input required ou não required?

- prop forwarding

- wrapper component as prop (string when built-in, fn when custom)

- update state based on the previous one => use function on setState fn

- two-way binding => input com value e onChange do value

- lifting the state up => parent component managing state that is used in both siblings component

- derived state = var that is set based on a prop/state
	- derive as much as possible
